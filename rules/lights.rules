/**
 * Various rules to turn on/off the lights.
 *  - Turn on the foyer light when garage or front door is open.
 *  - For any light that was turned on programatically, automatically turn off
 *    after 5 minutes.
 *  - Cancel turn-off timer if the light was switched off manually.
 *
 * The timers are not enabled if the system is in vacation mode when the lights
 * are turned on/off randomly to simulate owner presence (thief prevention).
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - time-of-day.rules for calculation of day periods.
 *   - presence.rules for VT_In_Vacation setting.
